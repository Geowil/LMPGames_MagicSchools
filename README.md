# Magic Schools Plugin
Welcome to my Magic Schools plugin.  Below is some general information about the plugin while I prepare the final version of this documentation.


## What is this?
This repo contains my Magic Schools RPG Maker MV plugin.  This plugin allows you to alter the way spells are learned by magic users.


You configure elemental schools of magic, each one corresponding to the elements in your game.  Each school has a variety of different settings for calculating costs if you have one cost systems enabled.

Each school also has configuration options for spell trees.  Spell trees are used to group like magic (IE: Fire, Fira, Firaga) and provide a natural look and feel towards spell progression which is missing from RPG Maker.
